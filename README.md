# A modern image gallery with React Suspense

![Screenshot](https://andris.gauracs.com/images/c997ed37-294d-4b04-bf25-c3970f0c4b6f.gif)

This is an image gallery that lazy loads images on the fly upon scrolling, but is also capable of showing a low resolution version of the desired image while waiting for the asynchronous high resolution image delivery. This allows us to show a downscaled version of the image for users with slower network speeds, thus providing a better and more appealing user experience.

### Run

```sh
$ cd react-suspense-image-loader
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
